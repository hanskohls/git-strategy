git-strategy
============

This is a combined git tutorial for my own and other git new-user requirements as well as a branching strategy document.


branching
=========

We will have three branch types live, release candidate and features.

To create a branch run the following command: 

```
git branch <branchname>
git checkout <branchname>
// Make your changes
git commit -a -m "<commit message>"
// After committing make some more changes and commit again.
```
